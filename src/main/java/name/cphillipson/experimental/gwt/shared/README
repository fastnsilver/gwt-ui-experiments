GWT Shared

Shared resources.  These may be used on both the client and server sides.

The shared codebase is organized into the following directory structure:

bean                These are for the most part, data-transfer objects.  They are agnostic of domain.
                    That is to say they are fit for use with banner, top nav, tree nav, and grid rendering components.
                    
i18n                Localization constants and an extension of GWT's com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Messages interface.
                    For more information on GWT's i18n support, see: http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideI18n.html.
                    
util                A client-safe UUID generator.  For use with NavNode and NavOption serialization/deserialization.

Note: all service end points should be defined in Endpoints interface
