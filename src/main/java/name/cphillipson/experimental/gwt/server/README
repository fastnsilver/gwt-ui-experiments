GWT Server

The actual "deployable":

                                        
    b) gwt-ui-experiments       this is used for test purposes only, backed by an in-memory mock 
                                datasource, and is a "proving ground" for new UI component development
                                        
                                        most data is constructed and retrieved from Stub* prefixed classes


The server-side codebase is organized into the following directory structure:

config                  Spring Java config.  All Spring beans are declared/integrated here. 

dao                     Data access objects.  

nav                     Navigation infrastructure.  Services and utilities for building data to be presented in hierarchical fashion.

controller              Implementations of REST and GWT RPC Service controllers via Spring MVC
    stub                    Stub implementations that take the place of real database-backed services


Note:

Async services (really these are service wrappers) should be registered in GwtConfig.

All service interfaces and implementations are RPC based.
