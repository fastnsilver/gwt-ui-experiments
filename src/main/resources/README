ATTENTION
 -- Be sure to synch the contents of the build/wsdl directory with the one that exists in the spp-emkt-ws-api module.
 
 -- Contents of the sample sub-directory contain examples of Spring bean config, particularly 
    declaring Apache CXF web service infrastructure and implementations for deployment.  This directory is not packaged in
    the resulting WAR.  It is up to the developer to create (and maintain) like configuration for use in deployable.
