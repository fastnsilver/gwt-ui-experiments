GWT UI EXPERIMENTS
====================
A web application with intention of integrating and testing various GWT components and capabilities in addition
to other third-party frameworks and components.  The intent this app is to explore and demonstrate specific functional use cases,
including but not restricted to: hyperlink-based navigation, client and server side validation, bookmark-ability (history supprt), GWT RPC and REST
requests, securing (not displaying) UI controls based on user role(s), and CRUS database interaction(s) while embracing modern, well-known development patterns.


ABOUT THE APP
--------------------
Sample market user interface.  User interacts via tab and tree navigation to view/edit forms and grids of energy
market related data.   Note: This application is very much a work in-progress!

Be sure to consult the individual READMEs in name.cphillipson.experimental

for further details.


DEMO
--------------------
A demo instance is deployed on Google App Engine, here: http://gwt-ui-experiments.appspot.com

(As of 2012-03-13, data grids will not render.  Researching why this is so.  If you attempt to deploy this app
yourself locally using one of the supported containers mentioned below, you will not run into this problem).
 

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------
JDK 6 (1.6.0_27 or better)
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
    
Maven (3.0.3 or better)
   http://maven.apache.org/ 
   
Google Web Toolkit (2.4)
    http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html
    

Set JAVA_HOME, MAVEN_HOME and MAVEN_OPTS environment variables

Mvp4g 1.4.0 has not propagated to the Maven Public repositories since being released 2012-02-18.  
You will most likely need to install it into your Maven local repository. 
Get it here: http://code.google.com/p/mvp4g/downloads/detail?name=mvp4g-1.4.0.jar&can=2&q=
See http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-install-plugin/examples/specific-local-repo.html for how to install.
Match the <groupId>, <artifactId>, and <version> for the <dependency> in pom.xml.


RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------
If you're proficient with Eclipse, use the latest release of the SpringSource ToolSuite IDE (based on Eclipse).
To download and install, go here:  http://www.springsource.com/downloads/sts.
Then configure "Extensions" to download and install the Google Web Toolkit plugin.

Make certain Maven reserves adequate RAM
    MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m

Add the following instruction within <pluginGroups></pluginGroups> of your settings.xml

    <pluginGroup>org.mortbay.jetty</pluginGroup>


TO BUILD
--------------------

To compile, test (includes unit and integration tests), and install all projects into your local .m2 repo, use

    mvn clean install

To compile and install without running tests, use

    mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
    

TO GENERATE DOCUMENTATION
--------------------

To stage for local viewing, use

    mvn -P documentation site:site site:stage
    
View the /target/staging directory for output.


TO GENERATE DEPENDENCY GRAPH 
--------------------

    mvn -P graph graph:reactor -Dhide-scope=test -Dhide-optional=true

The above command will generate an aggregate graph (in .png format) of all the dependencies of the projects in SPP MUI 's multi-module (a.k.a. reactor) build.
It generates a file named reactor-graph.png in the /target directory.


DEBUGGING AND/OR TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------
To debug this app in GWT development mode

    mvn gwt:debug
    

For more detail on other gwt-maven-plugin options, run
    
    mvn help:describe -DgroupId=org.codehaus.mojo -DartifactId=gwt-maven-plugin -Ddetails 


DEPLOYING/RUNNING
--------------------        
To run this webapp, on

    JETTY 8  (LOCALHOST)
    
    mvn jetty:run-war                    (to start the container)
    press Ctrl+C                         (to stop the container)
    
    visit http://localhost:8080
    

    TOMCAT 6 (LOCALHOST)

    mvn -P tomcat6x cargo:start          (to start the container)
    press Ctrl+C                         (to stop the container)
    
    visit http://localhost:8081
    logs to be found in /target/tomcat6x directory
    
    
    JBOSS 5.1.2 (LOCALHOST)

    mvn -P jboss51x cargo:start -Djboss51x.home=/path/to/jboss       (to start the container)
    press Ctrl+C                                                     (to stop the container)
        
    /path/to/jboss is the directory where you've installed JBOSS 5.1 on your workstation/laptop
    be sure to consult TFS SPP/Deployment/JBoss 5.1 configuration-steps.txt as an "out-of-box" installation will need some tweaking
         
    visit http://localhost:8081
    logs to be found in /target/jboss51x directory
    

ROADMAP
--------------------  

* Fix bookmark-ability (history support)
* Get client and server side validation working 
* Add database -- bootstrap db schema from hibernate entities
*** Persist data -- round-trip get/post/put/delete
* Add security -- Spring Security, authentication and authorization of tabs, menu items and form/grid display/actions.
